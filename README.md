# About Me

Hi! I'm Rowan, I love programming, game design and sharing those passions with others! You'll normally find me designing system architectures, topping up my coffee cup for the 5th time today and teaching junior developers how to take their code to the next level.

## Working with me

I'm a full stack engineer with around two dozen shipped products under my belt.

If you're a going-places tech company, I can bring a wealth of experience, insight and skill to your team! Don't be shy - take a look at [my website](https://hive-mind-studios.webs.com/) and my CV and then [drop me an email](mailto:powellrowan@gmail.com?subject=[Come%20work%20with%20us!])!

If you're a beginner developer looking for a helping hand, consider reaching out for advice or to talk about working one of my games!
